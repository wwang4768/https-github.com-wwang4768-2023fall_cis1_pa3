Computer Integrated Surgery 1 - Programming Assignment 3 By Zechen Xv (zxu139), Esther Wang (wwang177)

Please kindly find the file listing below, as well as more information on program structure in the report. More details are discussed in our report.

PROGRAMS Folder File Listing:
calibration_library.py: the script that all relevant frame transformation, set registration and pivot calibration methods reside

dataParsing_library.py: the script that read in input data and parses it into consumable format for the algorithm in calibration_library.py to further process

distortion_library.py: the script that handles distortion correction based on Berstein polynomials through fitting and other computation, then finally returns the corrected points

icp_library.py: the script that computes the closest point on a 3D mesh surface to a given point through projection to line segment, return the 3D location of the respective vertices of the triangular mesh and evaluates the error between corresponding points in the two point cloud 

homework_3.py: the driver code for programming assignment 3, which read in input data from source files stored under "pa345_student_data", performs set registration and finds the closest point (vertex) on the triangular 3D mesh surface to the given pointer tip points, then output the result to a txt file named “PA3-{choose_set}-{input_type}-Output.txt.” Please refer to the report for more details.

debug_test.py: the script that contains a series of unittest that examines the basic functionality of implementation in distortion library, calibration_library, icp_library and dataParsing_library which serves our debugging purpose during the development process

error_analysis.py: the script that contains functions that evaluate the error range of the output generated by homework_3.py 

Terminal Commands:
To run the driver code, please enter below in the terminal:
python homework_3.py {choose_set} {input_type} 

For example, "python .\homework_3.py A Debug" 

To run the driver code, please enter below in the terminal:
python debug_test.py
python error_analysis.py {choose_set} {input_type}
